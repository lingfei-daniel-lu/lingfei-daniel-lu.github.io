title: "Exchange Rate Pass-Through and Importers' Credit Constraints: Evidence from China"
venue: "Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization"
excerpt: 'This paper examines the patterns of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) among Chinese importers and the role played by credit constraints in shaping the ERPT. Using highly dis-aggregated firm-product-country-level transaction data from 2000 to 2007, we find that (1) the average level of ERPT into import prices in China is around 73%; (2) for importers in financially more constrained sectors, ERPT tends to be more complete; (3) a higher degree of import sourcing diversity leads to a less complete pass-through and partially offsets the effects of credit constraints. Our findings demonstrate the significance of credit constraints in governing ERPT into import prices. Furthermore, a more diversified import sourcing network can enhance the ability of importers to cope with exchange rate shocks and help alleviate the impact of financial constraints on international trade.'

  This paper examines the patterns of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) among Chinese importers and the role played by credit constraints in shaping the ERPT. Using highly dis-aggregated firm-product-country-level transaction data from 2000 to 2007, we find that (1) the average level of ERPT into import prices in China is around 73%; (2) for importers in financially more constrained sectors, ERPT tends to be more complete; (3) a higher degree of import sourcing diversity leads to a less complete pass-through and partially offsets the effects of credit constraints. Our findings demonstrate the significance of credit constraints in governing ERPT into import prices. Furthermore, a more diversified import sourcing network can enhance the ability of importers to cope with exchange rate shocks and help alleviate the impact of financial constraints on international trade.

highlights: |-
  - The average exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) into import prices in China is around 73%.
  - Tighter financial constraints of importers amplifies ERPT into import prices.
  - In opposite, greater sourcing diversity of importers reduces import ERPT.
  - We develop a model of bilateral negotiation to rationalize empirical patterns.
