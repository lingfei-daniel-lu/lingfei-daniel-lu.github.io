title: "Import-Export Linkages as a Channel for Exchange Rate Hedging"
excerpt: "This paper shows that firms hedge exchange rate risk through their import–export linkages. Using Chinese customs micro data, I document that exchange rate shocks from import origins and export markets have opposite effects on export growth, and that these elasticities are markedly attenuated for two-way traders. Moreover, greater overlap between a firm's supplier and destination portfolios further dampens the shock transmission. I develop a tractable trade model with pricing-to-market exports and global sourcing of inputs. Multilateral currency covariance and firm network shares jointly shape exposure of price competitiveness and cost channels. For risk averse firms under mean–variance trade-off, exchange rate uncertainty creates risk-adjusted pricing premia and reallocates firms' import shares toward currencies that offset revenue exposure. I also provide counterfactual experiments to illustrate how natural hedging works in alternative trade structure and exchange rate environments."

  This paper shows that firms hedge exchange rate risk through their import–export linkages. Using Chinese customs micro data, I document that exchange rate shocks from import origins and export markets have opposite effects on export growth, and that these elasticities are markedly attenuated for two-way traders. Moreover, greater overlap between a firm's supplier and destination portfolios further dampens the shock transmission. I develop a tractable trade model with pricing-to-market exports and global sourcing of inputs. Multilateral currency covariance and firm network shares jointly shape exposure of price competitiveness and cost channels. For risk averse firms under mean–variance trade-off, exchange rate uncertainty creates risk-adjusted pricing premia and reallocates firms' import shares toward currencies that offset revenue exposure. I also provide counterfactual experiments to illustrate how natural hedging works in alternative trade structure and exchange rate environments.
