title: "The Spill-back and Spillover Effects of US Monetary Policy: Evidence on an International Cost Channel"
excerpt: 'We find that an unanticipated tightening of US monetary policy tends to raise US import prices. This empirical "spill-back" pattern differs from the predictions of typical open-economy macro models. We also document a new empirical "spillover" effect: import prices of other countries also rise following an unexpected US monetary tightening. To understand the mechanism, we examine Chinese exporters and identify a borrowing cost channel - their liquidity conditions generally deteriorate after a US monetary tightening. Indeed, the output price response is greater for those firms facing higher borrowing costs or tighter liquidity conditions.'

  We find that an unanticipated tightening of US monetary policy tends to raise US import prices. This empirical "spill-back" pattern differs from the predictions of typical open-economy macro models. We also document a new empirical "spillover" effect: import prices of other countries also rise following an unexpected US monetary tightening. To understand the mechanism, we examine Chinese exporters and identify a borrowing cost channel - their liquidity conditions generally deteriorate after a US monetary tightening. Indeed, the output price response is greater for those firms facing higher borrowing costs or tighter liquidity conditions.
